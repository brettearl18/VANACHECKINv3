# Security Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens with longer expiration (7 days)
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- User roles:
  - Admin
  - Coach
  - Client
- Permission matrix:
  ```
  Admin:
  - Manage all users
  - Manage all programs
  - View all analytics
  - Manage system settings

  Coach:
  - Manage own clients
  - Create/edit programs
  - View client analytics
  - Manage check-ins

  Client:
  - View assigned programs
  - Submit check-ins
  - View own progress
  ```

## Data Security

### Encryption
- All data in transit encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Sensitive data at rest encrypted using AES-256
- Database encryption enabled
- File storage encryption enabled

### Password Security
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour

### API Security
- Rate limiting:
  - 100 requests/minute for authenticated users
  - 20 requests/minute for unauthenticated users
- CORS configuration:
  ```javascript
  {
    origin: ['https://vanacheckin.com'],
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
    credentials: true
  }
  ```
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- XSS prevention using content security policy

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- VPC configuration with private subnets
- Security groups limiting access
- WAF rules for common attacks
- DDoS protection enabled

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Audit trail for sensitive operations
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activities
- Regular security log reviews

### Backup & Recovery

- Point-in-time recovery enabled
- Backup encryption
- Regular recovery testing

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- Data minimization
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Privacy by design
- Data processing agreements

### CCPA Compliance
- Right to know
- Right to delete
- Right to opt-out
- Financial incentives

### HIPAA Compliance (if applicable)
- BAA agreements
- PHI encryption
- Access controls
- Audit logging

## Security Best Practices

### Development

   - Code review requirements
   - Static analysis tools

2. **Environment Security**
   - Separate development/staging/production
   - Secret management
   - Environment variable protection
   - Access control

3. **Testing**
   - Security testing in CI/CD
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Regular security audits

### Operations
1. **Access Management**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews
   - MFA for all admin access
   - Session management

2. **Incident Response**
   - Security incident response plan
   - Regular incident response drills
   - Communication protocols
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Alert thresholds
   - Response procedures
   - Regular review of security metrics

   - Single user affected
   - No data breach
   - Quick resolution

2. **Level 2 - Moderate**
   - Multiple users affected
   - Potential data exposure
   - Requires investigation

3. **Level 3 - Severe**
   - System-wide impact
   - Confirmed data breach
   - Requires immediate action

### Response Procedures

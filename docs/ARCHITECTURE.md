#### Key Design Patterns
- Atomic Design methodology for component organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Custom hooks for business logic
- React Query for server state management
- TypeScript for type safety

### Backend Architecture

#### API Layer
- Next.js API routes for serverless functions
- RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Data Layer
- Firebase/PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Redis for caching (optional)
- Prisma ORM for database operations

#### Integration Points
- Stripe for payment processing
- OpenAI for AI insights
- SendGrid for email notifications
- Firebase Auth for authentication

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
